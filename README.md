# prompt_engineering
Some python programs to generate prompts

1. Generate product description
 This is a Python script that demonstrates the power of prompt engineering for generating high-quality product descriptions. It showcases how to dynamically enhance prompts based on specific constraints and context to improve the output of a language model.
Features

Template-Based Prompting: The script defines different base templates for various writing styles (professional, casual, technical).
Prompt Enhancement: It adds specific constraints, context, and parameters to the base prompts to improve the quality of the generated descriptions.
Quality Evaluation: The script includes a function to analyze the prompts based on metrics like specificity, clarity, context, and constraint inclusion, and calculates an overall quality score.
Context Management: The code handles product information and maintains consistent style across different prompt variations.

Usage

Clone the repository:

Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/prompt-engineering-demo.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copycd prompt-engineering-demo

Run the script:

Copypython prompt_engineering_demo.py
The script will generate three different product descriptions using the professional, casual, and technical prompt styles. It will print the enhanced prompts, the generated descriptions, and the prompt quality metrics for each style.
Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
